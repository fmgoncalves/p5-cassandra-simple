NAME
    Cassandra::Simple

VERSION
    version 0.1

DESCRIPTION
    Easy to use, Perl oriented client interface to Apache Cassandra.

    This module attempts to abstract the underlying Thrift methods as much
    as possible to allow any Perl developer a small learning curve when
    using Cassandra.

SYNOPSYS
            None yet...

  get
    Usage: "get($column_family, $key[, opt])"

    $opt is a *HASH* and can have the following keys:

      columns, column_start, column_finish, column_count, column_reversed,
      consistency_level_read

    Returns an HASH of the form "{ column => value, column => value }"

  multiget
    Usage: "multiget($column_family, $keys[, opt])"

    $keys should be an *ARRAYREF* of keys to fetch.

    All parameters in $opt are the same as in "get()"

    Returns an HASH of the form "{ key => { column => value, column => value
    }, key => { column => value, column => value } }"

  get_count
    Usage: "get_count($column_family, $key[, opt])"

    $opt is a *HASH* and can have the following keys:

      columns, column_start, column_finish, consistency_level_read

    Returns the count as an int

  multiget_count
    Usage: "multiget_count($column_family, $keys[, opt])"

    $keys should be an *ARRAYREF* of keys.

    All parameters in $opt are the same as in "get_count()"

    Returns a mapping of "key -> count"

  get_range
    Usage: "get_range( $column_family[, opt])"

    $opt is a *HASH* and can have the following keys:

      start, finish, columns, column_start, column_finish, column_reversed,
      column_count, row_count, consistency_level_read

    Returns an *HASH* of the form "{ key => { column => value, column =>
    value }, key => { column => value, column => value } }"

  get_indexed_slices
    Usage: "get_indexed_slices($column_family, $index_clause[, opt])"

    $index_clause is an *HASH* containing the following keys:

      expression_list, start_key, row_count

      The *expression_list* is an *ARRAYREF* of the form "[ [ column =>
      value ] ]"

    $opt is an *HASH* and can have the following keys:

      columns, column_start, column_finish, column_reversed, column_count,
      consistency_level_read

    Returns an *HASH* of the form "{ key => { column => value, column =>
    value }, key => { column => value, column => value } }"

  insert
    Usage: "insert($column_family, $key, $columns[, opt])"

    The *expression_list* is an *ARRAYREF* of the form "[ [ column => value
    ] ]"

    $opt is an *HASH* and can have the following keys:

      timestamp, ttl, consistency_level_write

  batch_insert
    Usage: "batch_insert($column_family, $rows[, opt])"

    $rows is an *HASH* of the form "{ key => [ [ column => value ] , [
    column => value ] ], key => [ [ column => value ] , [ column => value ]
    ] }"

    $opt is an *HASH* and can have the following keys:

      timestamp, ttl, consistency_level_write

  remove
    Usage: "remove($column_family[, $keys][, opt])"

    $keys is an *ARRAY* of keys to be deleted.

    A removal whitout keys truncates the whole column_family.

    $opt is an *HASH* and can have the following keys:

      columns, super_column, write_consistency_level

    The timestamp used for remove is returned.

    Methods

    The following are Thrift methods left unimplemented.

    Not all of these will be implemented, since some aren't useful to the
    common developer.

    Priority will be given to live schema updating methods.

      describe_cluster_name

      string describe_cluster_name()

      describe_keyspace

      KsDef describe_keyspace(string keyspace)

      describe_keyspaces

      list<KsDef> describe_keyspaces()

      describe_partitioner

      string describe_partitioner()

      describe_ring

      list<TokenRange> describe_ring(keyspace)

      describe_snitch

      string describe_snitch()

      describe_version

      string describe_version()

      system_add_column_family

      string system_add_column_family(CFDef cf_def)

      system_drop_column_family

      string system_drop_column_family(ColumnFamily column_family)

      system_add_keyspace

      string system_add_keyspace(KSDef ks_def)

      system_drop_keyspace

      string system_drop_keyspace(string keyspace)
